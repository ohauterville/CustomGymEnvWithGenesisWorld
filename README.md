# Custom environment Gym - GenesisWorld for custom RL tasks

This repository is to learn how to set a custom environment in Gym with Genesis-world.

I wish to learn how to use a powerful and fully pythonic differentiable simulator such as Genesis-World and also how to train my robots on my own tasks. 

Setting up my own environment was pretty straight forward. 
The difficult point now is to design a good reward function.
